# Copywriting Guidelines

Principles for effective marketing and sales copy that converts.

## Core Principles

### Sell Benefits, Not Features
Features describe what something is. Benefits describe what it does for the user.

**Bad copywriting:**
- "Our headphones have noise cancellation."
- "Mattress is soft."
- "Battery lasts 24 hours."

**Great copywriting:**
- "Hear music. Not the mess around you."
- "Fall asleep in minutes, not 70 sheep later."
- "Go all day without searching for a charger."

**Rule:** Always translate features into outcomes. Ask "so what?" until you reach the real benefit.

### Make the Reader Feel Smart
Don't try to sound smart. Make the reader feel smart. That's real persuasion.

**Bad copywriting:**
- "Ergonomic office chair."
- "High-speed blender."
- "Home security camera."

**Great copywriting:**
- "Work 8 hours without back pain."
- "Turn frozen fruits into creamy smoothies in 30 seconds."
- "See who's at your door—even when you're 3,000 miles away."

**Rule:** The copy should make them feel clever for understanding the value.

### Start with Their Pain
The best hook is not a question. It's a mirror. Show them their pain.

**Bad copywriting:**
- "Our coffee gives energy."
- "Fast project management tool."
- "Advanced CRM software."

**Great copywriting:**
- "Coffee that makes deadlines feel like dares."
- "Stop asking 'who's working on what?' 20 times a day."
- "Your leads are falling through the cracks. Again."

**Rule:** Don't start with what you sell. Start with what they struggle with.

### Be Specific
Vague copy is forgettable. Specific copy sticks.

**Bad copywriting:**
- "Save time."
- "Improve productivity."
- "Better results."

**Great copywriting:**
- "Cut meeting time from 60 minutes to 15."
- "Ship features in days, not sprints."
- "Close 3x more deals without working weekends."

**Rule:** Replace abstract benefits with concrete, measurable outcomes.

## Copywriting Formulas

### The Before-After-Bridge
1. **Before:** Describe their current pain
2. **After:** Paint the picture of life with your solution
3. **Bridge:** Show how you get them there

### Pain-Agitate-Solution
1. **Pain:** Identify the problem
2. **Agitate:** Make them feel it
3. **Solution:** Present your offer

### Feature-Advantage-Benefit
1. **Feature:** What it is
2. **Advantage:** What it does
3. **Benefit:** What it means for them

## Writing Effective Headlines

### The 4 U's Framework
Great headlines are:
1. **Useful:** Offers clear value
2. **Urgent:** Creates reason to act now
3. **Unique:** Different from alternatives
4. **Ultra-specific:** Concrete, not abstract

### Headline Templates
- `[Do desirable thing] without [undesirable thing]`
- `[Time saved] instead of [time wasted]`
- `Stop [pain point]. Start [desired outcome].`
- `[Outcome] in [short time], not [long time]`

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Leading with Features
Bad: "Our platform has AI-powered automation"
Good: "Automate the boring stuff. Focus on what matters."

### 2. Using Jargon
Bad: "Leverage our SaaS ecosystem for optimal synergy"
Good: "All your tools work together. Finally."

### 3. Burying the Benefit
Bad: "With our advanced technology and years of experience, we've built a tool that helps you manage projects more efficiently"
Good: "Stop chasing updates. Know what's happening in 10 seconds."

### 4. Being Vague
Bad: "Increase productivity and efficiency"
Good: "Close 3x more deals without working weekends"

## Power Words

### Action Words
- Automate, eliminate, skip, cut, remove
- Get, gain, achieve, reach, unlock
- Build, create, generate, produce
- Stop, avoid, prevent, protect

### Outcome Words
- Without, never, instantly, finally
- In [time], not [time]
- Instead of, rather than
- No more, zero, gone
